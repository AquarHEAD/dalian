"Dalian" is the heroine's name from "Dantalian no Shoka"(「ダンタリアンの書架」),
she is the manager of the demon's library, and this project intends to be my
entrance for the great library of Internet, and a replacement to those
about:blank or google.com in my browsers.

Publicly featuring bookmarks for quick reference and access on others computers
and activities which combines rss/oauth news updates from my frequent visited
social-alike websites.

Privately (after logged in) featuring bookmarks /w readlist-style feature and
a place to quickly collect piece of ideas (in text format), can also be used
as todo-list.
